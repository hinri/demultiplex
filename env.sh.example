### This is an example for the env.sh file file that meant to be
### source'd (not executed!) before using the scripts in this directory.
### It sets the PERLLIB and PATH to use for the scripts in this repo so
### that you don't have to rely on hard-wired paths. 
##
### Copy it to env.sh and adjust to needs. If all your git checkouts are
### contained in one directory (e.g. $HOME/git), just adjust variable
### gitroot below and you should be fine.

gitroot=$HOME/git
h=$gitroot/demultiplex
PATH=$h:$PATH
PERLLIB=$h:$PERLLIB

unset gitroot h
