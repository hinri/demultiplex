# Comments in this file are ignored.  Two columns (space or
# tab-delimited) specify the barcode id and the bardcode respectively.
# A lower case letter in the barcode means: this letter (in uppercase)
# at this position must *always* be exact This can be used if some
# barcodes are not different enough from one another to allow a fixed
# number of mismatches. (The example in M2 below is contrived since the
# barcodes have a hamming distance of at least 2)
